        <p>Welcome to Jaden's Tree Fort, this is a children's learning and fun activity website.</p>
    <p>Navigate through the different pages using the colored tabs on the left hand side.</p>
        <p>The site is divided up into two main sections for now: Reading, and Math. Each one of those sections will have different activities for your child, they will help them work on basic skills. 
        </p>
        <p>For now this site will work on kindergarden level skills, But check back all the time because we will be adding different activities later, and the skill level will  increase</p>
        <p>Click on any of the words in the reading pages to have the word read aloud to your child</p>
